# CPlus-Projects
Short projects written in C++

## Linked List
1. Write a complete code to implement a linked list for int. For a given input integer n, your code should complete the following tasks:
• Insert the integers 1, 2, · · · , n one-by-one and in sorted order.
• Print all the elements in the constructed linked list. For example input n = 5, your program should
output: 12345
• Reverse the linked list and print all the elements in the reversed-list.

## Map
2. Write a complete program which uses map to solve the two sum problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Recursion
3. Use recursion to implement a function bool find(string s, string t) that tests whether a string t is contained in a string s.
